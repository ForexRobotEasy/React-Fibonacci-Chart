# React Fibonacci Chart

This is a React component that displays a Fibonacci chart based on fetched bar data. It calculates Fibonacci retracement levels for the selected bar and displays them along with whether they have been touched or not.

## How it works
1. The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize the `barData` and `fibonacciLevels` states.
2. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the bar data from an API and update the `barData` state.
3. The `useEffect` hook is also used to calculate the Fibonacci retracement levels based on the fetched bar data and update the `fibonacciLevels` state.
4. The component renders a header with the title 'React Fibonacci Chart'.
5. It also renders a select element to choose the time frame for the chart.
6. The Fibonacci levels are displayed along with whether they have been touched or not.
